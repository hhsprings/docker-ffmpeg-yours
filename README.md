# docker-ffmpeg-yours
Ffmpeg on docker for you.

The purpose of this project is not to provide off-the-shelf products, but to "provide a template for you to create ffmpeg for yourself".

## What kind of people is it for?
First of all, this is for people who are dissatisfied with ffmpeg provided by linux distributors.
And this is for people who have some understanding of linux and are willing to build ffmpeg on their own.
